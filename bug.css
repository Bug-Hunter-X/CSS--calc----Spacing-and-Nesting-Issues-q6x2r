The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes produce unexpected results if you don't properly space the operators and values within the calculation. For instance,  `width:calc(100%-10px);` will work correctly, whereas `width:calc(100% - 10px);` will likely fail.  Another issue can arise when nesting `calc()` expressions.  The order of operations might not behave intuitively unless carefully parenthesized.
