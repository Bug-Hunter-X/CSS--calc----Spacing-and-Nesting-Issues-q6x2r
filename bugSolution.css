The solution is to ensure correct spacing around operators (+, -, *, /) within `calc()` and to carefully parenthesize nested expressions. For example, to calculate a width that's 100% minus 10 pixels, use:

```css
width: calc(100% - 10px);
/* Correct spacing */
```

For nested expressions, ensure the order of operations is clear through the use of parentheses:

```css
width: calc( (100% - 10px) / 2 );
/* Correctly parenthesized nested expression */
```
Failing to do so may result in unexpected results or parse errors. Always double-check your spacing and parentheses when using `calc()` to avoid such issues.
